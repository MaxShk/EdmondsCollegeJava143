project #1:

1) Left Click the tile you want to raise (bring forward) from the rest.
2) Right click the tile you want to bring behind from the rest
3) Use the method to retrieve x and y location from a tile, and where clicked, and use that infromation in an if/else statement to determine if the tile was clicked on
4) resolution of the drawing panel is located in the TileMain class. Can be used to determine the x and Y axis of the panel.
5) comments:
	1) what does this method do? why would i call this?
	2) What are the parameters? (write useful information, what do the parameters represent)
	3) Mention (if applicable) preconditions, something that your method assumes is true at the start of its execution

6) All fields (methods and variables) should be private

Office hours, same zoom link as it is for the lab class

public void raise(int x, int y) {
        for(int i = list.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            Tile tile = list.get(i);
            if(x >= tile.getX() && x <= tile.getX() + tile.getWidth() &&
                    y >= tile.getY() && y <= tile.getY() + tile.getHeight()) {
                list.remove(i);
                list.add(tile);
                break;
            }
        }
