Write a method named unionSets that accepts as a parameter a Set of Sets of integers, and returns a Set of integers representing the union of all of the sets of ints. (A union is the combination of everything in each set.) For example, calling your method on the following set of sets:

[[1, 3], [2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 5, 6, 7], [42]]
Should cause the following set of integers to be returned:

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 42]



Solution:

    public static Set<Integer> unionSets(Set<Set<Integer>> sets) {
        Set<Integer> unionSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (Set<Integer> set : sets) {
            unionSet.addAll(set);
        }
        return unionSet;
    }
