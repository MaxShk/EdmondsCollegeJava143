Language/Type: Java hashing HashIntSet implementing

Write a method named addAll that could be placed inside the HashIntSet class. This method accepts another HashIntSet as a parameter and adds all elements from that set into the current set, if they are not already present. For example, if a set s1 contains [1, 2, 3] and another set s2 contains [1, 7, 3, 9], the call of s1.addAll(s2); would change s1 to store [1, 2, 3, 7, 9] in some order.

You are allowed to call methods on your set and/or the other set. Do not modify the set passed in. This method should run in O(N) time where N is the number of elements in the parameter set passed in.


Solution:

public void addAll(HashIntSet s) {
    for(int i = 0; i < s.elementData.length; i++) {
        Node node = s.elementData[i];

        while(node != null) {
            if(!this.contains(node.data))
                this.add(node.data);
            node = node.next;
        }
    }
}
