Language/Type: Java binary search trees tree traversals

Suppose that the following elements are added in the specified order to an empty binary search tree:

Kirk, Spock, Scotty, McCoy, Chekov, Uhuru, Sulu, Khaaaan!
Write the elements of the tree above in the order they would be seen by a pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Type your solutions with the elements separated by spaces and/or commas, such as:

One, Two, Three, Four

Solution:

pre-order	
Kirk, Chekov, Khaaaan!, Spock, Scotty, McCoy, Uhuru, Sulu
in-order	
Chekov, Khaaaan!, Kirk, McCoy, Scotty, Spock, Sulu, Uhuru
post-order	
Khaaaan!, Chekov, McCoy, Scotty, Sulu, Uhuru, Spock, Kirk
