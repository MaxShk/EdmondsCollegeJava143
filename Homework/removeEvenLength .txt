Language/Type: Java ArrayList Collections

Write a method named removeEvenLength that accepts an ArrayList of strings as a parameter and that removes all of the strings of even length from the list. For example, if an ArrayList variable named list contains the values ["hi", "there", "how", "is", "it", "going", "good", "sirs"], the call of removeEvenLength(list); would change it to store ["there", "how", "going"].


Solution:

public static void removeEvenLength(ArrayList<String> list) {
        for (int i = list.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (list.get(i).length() % 2 == 0) {
                list.remove(i);
            }
        }
    }
