writeTree 
Language/Type: Java binary trees

Write a method named writeTree that prints a binary tree of integers in a specific format. Your method accepts as its parameter a TreeNode that refers to the root of the tree. You are to perform a pre-order traversal of the tree, producing exactly one line of output for each node. Each output line should begin with a code indicating the type of node from the following table, followed by the data in the node:

Code	Node Type
0	leaf node (no children)
1	branch node with left child only
2	branch node with right child only
3	branch node with left and right children
For example, suppose a variable named tree refers to the root of the following tree:

    7____
   /     \
  9     __8
 /     /   \
5     4     6
       \
        9
The call of writeTree(tree); would produce the following console output:

3 7
1 9
0 5
3 8
2 4
0 9
0 6
Assume that you are interacting with TreeNodes as defined below:

public class TreeNode {
    public int data;
    public TreeNode left;
    public TreeNode right;
    
    public TreeNode() { ... }
    public TreeNode(int data) { ... }
    public TreeNode(int data, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) { ... }
}



Solution:

public static void writeTree(TreeNode node) {
    if (node == null) {
        // empty tree, do nothing
        return;
    }
    
    // write the type code and data for the current node
    int type = 0;
    if (node.left != null) {
        type += 1;
    }
    if (node.right != null) {
        type += 2;
    }
    System.out.println(type + " " + node.data);
    
    // recursively print the left and right subtrees
    writeTree(node.left);
    writeTree(node.right);
}
