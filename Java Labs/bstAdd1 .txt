Suppose that the following elements are added in the specified order to an empty binary search tree:

Leia, Boba, Darth, R2D2, Han, Luke, Chewy, Jabba
Write the elements of the tree above in the order they would be seen by a pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Type your solutions with the elements separated by spaces and/or commas, such as:

One, Two, Three, Four


Solution:

pre-order	
Leia, Boba, Darth, Chewy, Han, Jabba, R2D2, Luke
in-order	
Boba, Chewy, Darth, Han, Jabba, Leia, Luke, R2D2
post-order	
Chewy, Jabba, Han, Darth, Boba, Luke, R2D2, Leia
