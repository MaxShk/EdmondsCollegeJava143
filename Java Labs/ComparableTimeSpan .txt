Modify the TimeSpan class from Chapter 8 to include a compareTo method that compares time spans by their length. A time span that represents a shorter amount of time is considered to be "less than" one that represents a longer amount of time. For example, a span of 3 hours and 15 minutes is greater than a span of 1 hour and 40 minutes.


Solution:

public int compareTo(TimeSpan other){
	int thisMinutes = this.hours * 60 + this.minutes;
    int otherMinutes = other.hours * 60 + other.minutes;
    
    return Integer.compare(thisMinutes, otherMinutes);
}
