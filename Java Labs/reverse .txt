reverse 
Language/Type: Java implementing Linked Lists LinkedIntList
Related Links:LinkedIntList.java

Write a method reverse that reverses the order of the elements in the list. For example, if the variable list initially stores this sequence of integers:

[1, 8, 19, 4, 17]
It should store the following sequence of integers after reverse is called:

[17, 4, 19, 8, 1]
Assume that you are adding this method to the LinkedIntList class as defined below:

public class LinkedIntList {
    private ListNode front;   // null for an empty list
    ...
}


Solution:

public void reverse() {
    if (front == null || front.next == null) {
        // If the list is empty or has only one element, there's nothing to reverse.
        return;
    }
    ListNode prev = null;
    ListNode curr = front;
    ListNode next = null;
    while (curr != null) {
        next = curr.next; // save next node
        curr.next = prev; // reverse link
        prev = curr;      // update prev
        curr = next;      // update curr
    }
    front = prev;         // update front
}
